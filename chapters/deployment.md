__The focus of this guide is on easy to follow step-by-step instructions__

## Sharing Locally
You can export to a variety of formats from within the notebook by navigating to File -> Download As. You'll want to export your notebook as a Jupyter Interactive Notebook (.ipynb file format) if you'd like the person you're sharing it with to interact with the notebook.
